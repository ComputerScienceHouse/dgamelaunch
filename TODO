-allow admin to define series of actions dgl makes when user does
 something. for example, do "mkdir dgldir/rcfiles/$nick" and
 "cp defaultrc dgldir/rcfiles/$nick/" when a new nick is registered.
 (action times: new nick registration, starting a game, login, edit options...)
 (actions: mkdir, cp, setenv, ...)
 this should allow for crawl's macro-file copying, while doing away any
 specific limitations for having just one config file per game, and
 allowing admin to set what env vars are defined for each game.
-allow configuring ttyplay.c; some games may use different clear-screen
 commands. (see for example crawl)
-return back to dgl after exiting the game. (on NAO, the dgl processes
 take 33m+ resident memory, so might not be viable unless we use sqlite3)
-public (no-password) accounts? (a per-user flag) what happens when someone
 is playing on the account and someone else logins and we start playing?
-change the watching screen not to show the 'press 'm' to mail user'
 part, if spool isn't enabled.
-info screen (more than just the banner), for info about the game(s)
 and the server, etc.
-allow more than one editor per dgl
-allow users to run recover themselves
-make dgl show # of watchers
-configurable environment variables for when the game is launched
-configurable stuff: allowed chars in usernames,
 allow char stripping, ...

- Flags for operators/staff/admins or (optionally) user-bans.

- Localization of variables, code clean up

- Use /var/run/nologin and/or dgl-specific nologin file

- Honor window size changes (currently the player has to relogin if window
  size changes)

- A way (config file or compile time) to disable things like registration or
  mail
