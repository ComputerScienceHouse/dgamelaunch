-for menu definitions, allow "default" commands (when user presses a
 key not defined in other commands):
   commands[default] = ...

-in watching-menu "The following games are in progress:" should change
 depending if there's only 1 game. It should also list the # of games.
-in watching-menu, maybe we shouldn't pick players who have been
 idle for too long when randomly choosing one to watch.
-change dgl-banner handling; we only use the top line of it nowadays...
 (maybe make that info config line: bannerline = "## $SERVERID" or something)
-allow the admin to config the watching menu:
  -top banner
  -bottom banner
  -remove and reorder the columns:
     watch_title = "   Name      Game  Size   Start date & time  Idle"
       this doesn't allow hiliting the sorted title, though...
     watch_columns = "0) 1  2  3  4 5  6"
       where the numbers correspond to the columns, everything else
       is passed through. the columns have default widths.
       col 0=selectletter, 1=playername, 2=gamenum, 3=termsize, 4=startdate,
           5=starttime, 6=idletime
  -set default sort method
  -selectorchars:
     watch_selectorchars = "abcdefghijklmn" (a-zA-Z, minus qQ)
  -keys:
     currently: qQ=return, '.'=sort++, ','=sort--, etc
-allow admin to set per-game "extra info" file,
   extrainfofile = "/nh343/var/extrainfo/%n.xtranfo"
 contents of which are shown in the watching menu as info-column.
 the game is responsible for updating the contents of that file.

-update virus to the newest version.
-allow changing the name where the ttyrecs are saved, like
  ttyrec_fn = "%rttyrec/%n/%g/%p.ttyrec"
-maybe save more stuff in the db, if we're using the sqlite
 (last login timestamp, watch-menu sort-type, etc)
-Allow using a ttyrec (or similar screen capture) as the menu
 text, instead of a text file.
 maybe adding a bannertype={auto,txt,ttyrec,screendump}
 into a menu def. auto=try to detect it from file extension.
-BUG: cannot quit watching until caught up with the stream.
-allow configuring the watching, new user registration,
 email/passwd change, etc. screens.
-make default_fmode configurable, and add config
 file command "chmod file mode"
-allow setting the new rcfile access rights.
-allow configuring the ttyrec dir location & file format.
-maybe allow changing the watching-screen &c layouts too?
-add commandline parameters to dgamelaunch:
   dgamelaunch --chpasswd "nick" "newpass"
-some games (robotfindskitten?) are not worth saving into ttyrecs, make it configurable.
-save the game name into ttyrec filename, so we can find what game it was.
-allow configuring ttyplay.c; some games may use different clear-screen
 commands. (see for example crawl)
-allow configuring the gfx stripping. (number of chars, types of stripping,
 include unicode stripping from crawl dgl, etc)
-public (no-password) accounts? (a per-user flag) what happens when someone
 is playing on the account and someone else logins and we start playing?
-info screen (more than just the banner), for info about the game(s)
 and the server, etc.
-allow more than one editor per dgl
-allow users to run recover themselves
-make dgl show # of watchers
-configurable stuff: allowed chars in usernames,
 allow char stripping, ...

- Flags for operators/staff/admins or (optionally) user-bans.

- Localization of variables, code clean up

- Use /var/run/nologin and/or dgl-specific nologin file

- Honor window size changes (currently the player has to relogin if window
  size changes)
