-Allow using a ttyrec (or similar screen capture) as the menu
 text, instead of a text file.
 maybe adding a bannertype={auto,txt,ttyrec,screendump}
 into a menu def. auto=try to detect it from file extension.
-BUG: cannot quit watching until caught up with the stream.
-allow configuring the watching, new user registration,
 email/passwd change, etc. screens.
-make default_fmode configurable, and add config
 file command "chmod file mode"
-allow setting the new rcfile access rights.
-allow configuring the ttyrec dir location & file format.
-maybe allow changing the watching-screen &c layouts too?
-add commandline parameters to dgamelaunch:
   dgamelaunch --chpasswd "nick" "newpass"
-some games (robotfindskitten?) are not worth saving into ttyrecs, make it configurable.
-save the game name into ttyrec filename, so we can find what game it was.
-allow configuring ttyplay.c; some games may use different clear-screen
 commands. (see for example crawl)
-allow configuring the gfx stripping. (number of chars, types of stripping,
 include unicode stripping from crawl dgl, etc)
-public (no-password) accounts? (a per-user flag) what happens when someone
 is playing on the account and someone else logins and we start playing?
-info screen (more than just the banner), for info about the game(s)
 and the server, etc.
-allow more than one editor per dgl
-allow users to run recover themselves
-make dgl show # of watchers
-configurable stuff: allowed chars in usernames,
 allow char stripping, ...

- Flags for operators/staff/admins or (optionally) user-bans.

- Localization of variables, code clean up

- Use /var/run/nologin and/or dgl-specific nologin file

- Honor window size changes (currently the player has to relogin if window
  size changes)
